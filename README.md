## Hobbies

My gaming journey began with the original DS, where I spent countless hours playing FIFA 07. 
The transition to the 3DS brought some of my most cherished gaming memories with thrilling matches in Inazuma Eleven Chrono Stones.

Anime has also become a significant part of my life. I've spent countless nights immersed in the world of One Piece, following Luffy and his crew on their epic adventures across the Grand Line.
