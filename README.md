#### Hobbies

My gaming journey began with the original DS, where I spent countless hours playing FIFA 07. The transition to the 3DS brought some of my most cherished gaming memories with thrilling matches in Inazuma Eleven Chrono Stones and exploring the Alola region in Pokémon Sun. There's something deeply nostalgic about those handheld gaming sessions that modern gaming just can't replicate.

Anime has also become a significant part of my life. I've spent countless nights immersed in the world of One Piece, following Luffy and his crew on their epic adventures across the Grand Line. There's something magical about those late-night binge sessions, getting lost in the rich storytelling and emotional moments that only anime can deliver.

Beyond watching anime, I've also developed a passion for reading manga, appreciating the incredible artistry and detailed storytelling that goes into each panel and chapter.
